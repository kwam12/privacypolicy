        <h2>Face Data and Photo Analysis</h2>
        <h3>1. What face data does the app collect?</h3>
        <p>The app collects a user-submitted photo that includes facial data for the purpose of skin analysis. This photo data is temporarily used for processing skin-related metrics and generating a skincare score.</p>

        <h3>2. Use of Face Data</h3>
        <p>The face data (user-submitted photo) is solely used to analyze skin health, specifically for identifying potential skin issues such as acne, dryness, or uneven tone, and to generate a personalized skincare score. This analysis is done in real time and only for the user's immediate viewing.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Sharing and Storage</h3>
        <p>The face data is transmitted to ChatGPT for processing, where the skin analysis score is generated and then returned to the app. Face data is not stored by ChatGPT after processing. Additionally, the app retains photos locally on the user's device only if the user chooses to save them for tracking their progress over time.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
        <p>The app does not retain face data on any external servers. Face data is only temporarily held during the analysis process and then deleted from ChatGPT immediately after processing.</p>
