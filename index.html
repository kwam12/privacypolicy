        <h2>Face Data and Photo Analysis</h2>
        <h3>1. What face data does the app collect?</h3>
        <p>The app collects a user-submitted photo that includes facial data for the purpose of skin analysis. This photo data is temporarily used for processing skin-related metrics and generating a skincare score.</p>

        <h3>2. Use of Face Data</h3>
        <p>The face data (user-submitted photo) is solely used to analyze skin health, specifically for identifying potential skin issues such as acne, dryness, or uneven tone, and to generate a personalized skincare score. This analysis is done in real time and only for the user's immediate viewing.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Practices</h3>
        <p>The face data is transmitted to OpenAI's ChatGPT API for processing, where the skin analysis score is generated. Here are the specific details about third-party handling of your face data:</p>
        
        <h4>OpenAI (ChatGPT)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> OpenAI temporarily stores face data during processing for a maximum of 30 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose of Storage:</strong> This temporary storage is necessary for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Service improvement and training</li>
                    <li>Debugging and error resolution</li>
                    <li>Compliance with legal requirements</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Storage Duration Justification:</strong> The 30-day retention period allows OpenAI to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Address any technical issues that may arise</li>
                    <li>Respond to user inquiries or disputes</li>
                    <li>Maintain service quality and accuracy</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> OpenAI implements industry-standard security measures to protect all processed data, including encryption and secure data centers.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>4. Data Retention in Our App</h3>
        <p>The app retains photos locally on the user's device only if the user explicitly chooses to save them for tracking their progress over time. Users can delete their locally stored photos at any time through the app's settings.</p>
